# twitter_USOpen2020

The aim of this project is to study how Twitter API works and how Spark Streaming integrates with it.

I use Twitter API to obtain realtime tweets during USOpen 2020 and visualize the top 20 popular users at the time.

Please see `twitter_usopen2020.md` for analysis, or get access to the analysis at [my blog](https://shyuwang.github.io/2020/09/11/twitter_usopen/).
